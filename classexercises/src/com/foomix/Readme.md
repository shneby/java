<h1>Social Network Application</h1>
<p>
Given the following partially specified requirements for a social network application Foomix and the ObjectOriented UML Class Diagram:


The Social Network Application Foomix allows friends to connect with each other online and share information
such as their photo albums or movies.


Foomix allows a user to register and fill in personal information. In
particular, it lets the user specify her name, birthday, address and a profile picture.


Once registered, a user can create photo albums that each has a list of pictures that the user has uploaded to
Foomix. The user can also upload movies to his profile. For each uploaded content, Foomix stores the time when
the content was added.


Each user has friends he is connected to and can add more users as friends. For this, a user can list all or search
for users registered with the FoomixNetwork.


Foomix also provides a marketplace that offers a variety of games a user can play. FarmTown and MafiaStruggle
are two of these games. New games can be added any time to the marketplace.
 
Once a user plays one of the offered games, the game remembers the user and its highest score in a ranking. Furthermore, users can rank the
games
